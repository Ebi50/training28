# 🚀 GitHub Upload Instructions

## ✅ Code is Committed Locally

Your code has been committed to git with the message:
```
Initial commit: Complete adaptive training system implementation
- 30 files changed, 13,764 lines added
- Commit hash: 0d24663
```

## 📤 Next: Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Create repository**:
   - Name: `adaptive-training-system` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Intelligent cycling training system with Strava integration`
   - Visibility: **Private** (recommended for now)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Push your code**:
   ```bash
   # Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Use Existing Repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
# Add your existing repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When pushing, GitHub will ask for authentication:

### Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy token and use as password when prompted

### Or use GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Then push normally
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ Verification

After pushing, verify at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
```

You should see:
- ✅ 30 files
- ✅ All documentation (README, SETUP_GUIDE, etc.)
- ✅ Source code in `src/` and `functions/`
- ✅ Configuration files

## 🎯 What's Already Done

✅ Git initialized
✅ All files added
✅ Initial commit created
✅ .gitignore configured (node_modules, .env, etc. excluded)

## ⏭️ When You Come Back

Next session, you can:
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...
