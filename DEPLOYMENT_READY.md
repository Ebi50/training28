✅ Activity import from Strava  
✅ TSS calculation (power/HR/RPE-based)  
✅ Weekly plan generation  
✅ LIT/HIT distribution  
✅ Time slot scheduling  
✅ Training camps  
✅ Season goals with taper  
✅ Post-camp deload  
✅ CTL/ATL/TSB tracking

## 🎯 Architecture Strengths

### Scalability
- Serverless (auto-scales to millions of users)
- Firestore (petabyte-scale database)
- Cloud Functions (concurrent execution)
- Pay-per-use pricing (starts nearly free)

### Security
- User-scoped data access
- OAuth 2.0 with token refresh
- Secrets in Secret Manager
- GDPR-ready architecture

### Maintainability
- TypeScript (catch errors at compile time)
- Modular structure (easy to extend)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear separation of concerns

---

## 🔍 Code Highlights

### Training Plan Generator
```typescript
// Generates intelligent weekly plans
const plan = await generator.generateWeeklyPlan(
  userId,
  weekStartDate,
  parameters,    // Hours, LIT/HIT ratio, slots
  previousMetrics, // CTL, ATL, TSB history
  upcomingGoals,   // Races with taper
  activeCamp       // Camp overrides
);
```

### Guardrails System
```typescript
// Prevents overtraining
- Max ramp rate: 15% per week
- No HIT back-to-back
- TSB monitoring (-20 to +15)
- Recovery enforcement
- Max 90min HIT/week
```

### Smart Scheduling
```typescript
// Respects your availability
- Morning/evening slots
- Indoor/outdoor preference
- Session splitting (90min → 2x60min)
- Camp flexible schedules
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### User Data
```
users/{uid}/
  ├── profile/main
  ├── integrations/strava
  ├── planning/
  │   ├── season_goals/{goalId}
  │   └── camps/{campId}
  ├── plans/{planId}
  └── activities/{activityId}

fact_daily_metrics/{uid}/metrics/{date}
```

### Key Collections
- **Season Goals**: A/B/C priority races
- **Camps**: Volume boost + deload
- **Plans**: Weekly sessions
- **Activities**: From Strava
- **Metrics**: CTL/ATL/TSB daily
